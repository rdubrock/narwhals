Almost all modern predation of narwhals is by humans.Other predators are polar bears, which attack at breathing holes mainly for young narwhals, Greenland sharks and walruse.  Killer whales (orcas) group together to overwhelm narwhal pods in the shallow water of enclosed bays,   To escape predators such as orcas, narwhals may use prolonged submergence to hide under ice floes rather than relying on speed.  Narwhals have to consciously decide to breathe, unlike us. This means that the whales don't sleep in quite the same way that we do, since part of their brain must make the decision to surface for air.</p>
