        <p>
          Previous studies have revealed bottlenose dolphins produce signature whistle vocalizations, the first evidence for this kind of communication among toothed whales.
          Although relatively little is known about narwhal communication, scientists have suspected that like other whales, these beasts also have excellent hearing.
          Found only in Arctic waters, the narwhal has a lone tusk that can be 6 feet long. They can migrate thousands of miles in large numbers, with subgroups moving in a coordinated fashion. So the distinct sounds could help individual members get in contact with other members of their group.
