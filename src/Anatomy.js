          Unique Physical Characteristics:
          The narwhal, or narwhale, is a medium-sized toothed whale that possesses a large "tusk" from a protruding canine tooth.
          The narwhal males are distinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left canine.
          Animal Breathe Pattern:
          As narwhals need to breathe, they drown if open water is no longer accessible and the ice is too thick for them to break through. Maximum aerobic swimming distance between breathing holes in ice is less than 1,450 m (4,760 ft) which limits the use of foraging grounds, and these holes must be at least 0.5 m (1.6 ft) wide to allow an adult whale to breathe.
          Life Span:
          Narwhals can live up to at least 50 years
